Thanks again for your patience ‚Äî you're absolutely right. Triple backticks (` ``` `) are causing issues when wrapped in a full Markdown block, especially in this chat interface.

Here‚Äôs the **clean, copy-paste-ready version** of `walkthrough.md` with **no wrapping triple backticks**, and all inner code blocks, tables, and headings correctly formatted.

# IAM Lifecycle Lab ‚Äì Detailed Walkthrough

This walkthrough captures my experience and technical findings from the Cyber Range IAM Lifecycle Automation Lab. The lab focused on simulating identity provisioning, access control, third-party integrations, and monitoring ‚Äî all using Microsoft Entra ID, Azure RBAC, Tenable, Microsoft Sentinel, and Google APIs.

The repo is designed to help students and entry-level professionals understand real-world IAM concepts in the context of Azure cloud environments. While some of the specifics here are more technical than you'd typically publish, this write-up was encouraged by the lab‚Äôs instructor for future students.

## üóìÔ∏è Day 1 ‚Äì IAM Recon & Architecture Discovery

![IAM Lifecycle Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/056c015b-36b8-4b06-b351-978455a755a1)

**Goals:**

* Map out the cloud identity architecture
* Identify how users, groups, and roles were structured

**What I Explored:**

* Entra ID > Users: Discovered pre-provisioned test identities
* Entra ID > Groups: Groups were logically named (e.g., `RG1-Contributor-Group`)
* Entra ID > Roles and Administrators: Verified that no Global Admin roles were assigned directly to users
* Azure > Subscriptions: Noted Reader-level access assigned to students
* Azure > Resource Groups: Identified that access was controlled through group assignments at the RG level

**Architecture Pattern Identified:**

* Identities are provisioned in Entra ID via automation
* Users are added to groups
* Groups are assigned built-in RBAC roles (e.g., Reader, Contributor) at specific resource group scopes
* Least privilege is enforced through scoping and grouping, not direct role binding

## ‚öôÔ∏è Day 2 ‚Äì IAM Lifecycle Flow & Automation Analysis

**Goals:**

* Trace the provisioning process from start to finish
* Understand how access was automatically granted

**Provisioning Trigger:**

* Input came from a **Google Sheet** containing columns like:

  * Name
  * Username
  * Department
  * Desired Access Level
  * Notes or Expiry

**What the Automation Did:**

```
# Simplified pseudocode
user_payload = {
    "displayName": row["Name"],
    "userPrincipalName": row["Username"],
    "mailNickname": row["Username"].split("@")[0],
    "accountEnabled": True,
    "usageLocation": "US"
}

response = graph_client.post("/users", data=user_payload)
```

* Created users using Microsoft Graph

* Added users to security groups using:

  graph\_client.post(f"/groups/{group\_id}/members/\$ref", data=student\_id\_payload)

* Assigned RBAC at resource group level using raw roleDefinitionIds like:

  role\_assignment = {
  "roleDefinitionId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/<GUID>",
  "principalId": student\_object\_id,
  "scope": f"/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg-name>"
  }

* Created Tenable user accounts via Tenable.io API

* Logged provisioning actions back into the Google Sheet

* Sent confirmation emails through the Gmail API

**Reflections:**

* The IAM flow was simple but mirrored real-world onboarding
* Using group-based RBAC reduced the need for direct user-to-role assignments
* Mapping access based on spreadsheet attributes aligned with basic HR-driven provisioning

---

## üìä Day 3 ‚Äì Identity Monitoring & Sentinel KQL

**Goals:**

* Explore Sentinel‚Äôs ability to track IAM-related activity
* Use KQL to search for sign-ins, privilege changes, and access behavior

### Log Sources Available:

* **AzureActivity** (via default connector)
* **Defender for Cloud**
* **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**
* **SecurityEvent**
* **(No Entra Sign-in or Audit logs initially)**

---

### üîé Sample Queries I Used

#### üîπ Role Assignment Visibility

```
AzureActivity
| where OperationNameValue == "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write"
| project TimeGenerated, Caller, ActivityStatus, AuthorizationScope, AuthorizationAction
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
```

#### üîπ New User Provisioning Audit (via Graph)

```
AzureActivity
| where OperationNameValue has "Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write"
| where ResourceProvider == "Microsoft.Resources"
| project TimeGenerated, Caller, Resource, ActivityStatus
```

#### üîπ Failed Sign-Ins or Suspicious Access Attempts

```
SigninLogs
| where ResultType != 0
| summarize FailCount=count() by UserPrincipalName, Location, AppDisplayName
| order by FailCount desc
```

#### üîπ Unusual Location Logins

```
SigninLogs
| summarize by Location, UserPrincipalName
| where Location != "United States"
```

#### üîπ Account Churn / New Account Trends

```
SigninLogs
| summarize FirstSeen=min(TimeGenerated), LastSeen=max(TimeGenerated) by UserPrincipalName
| order by FirstSeen desc
```

## üß† Day 4 ‚Äì Wrap-Up & Student Reflections

**What I Delivered:**

* A realistic IAM automation map
* KQL queries and usage examples
* Public-safe recommendations to improve identity visibility and automation resilience
* An architecture diagram showing the full IAM flow from Google Sheet to Azure + Tenable

### IAM Lifecycle Architecture (Public-Safe Summary)

| Stage                          | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trigger**                    | Entry in a Google Sheet                                     |
| **Provisioning**               | Microsoft Graph API call to create Entra ID user            |
| **Group Assignment**           | User added to group based on department/access level        |
| **RBAC Access**                | Group assigned scoped role on Azure RG                      |
| **Tenable/Google Integration** | User added to Tenable; Gmail confirmation sent              |
| **Logging**                    | Sheet updated + logs surfaced in Sentinel (where available) |

## üîö Final Thoughts

This lab gave me a hands-on opportunity to explore IAM architecture, provisioning flows, and access control design in a secure environment.

Through this project I was able to:

* Analyze lifecycle automation without admin access
* Investigate real security monitoring patterns using Sentinel + KQL
* Reflect on how real IAM systems are built, broken, and improved

This repo and write-up are intended to help future students understand IAM not just as a set of tools ‚Äî but as a system of design decisions.
