# IAM Recommendations (High-Level)

These recommendations are based on lessons learned during the IAM lifecycle automation lab conducted inside a Cyber Range. The goal is to highlight best practices, areas for improvement, and forward-looking IAM strategies in a general and public-safe way.

## 1. Identity Lifecycle Enhancements

**Observation:** The provisioning and deprovisioning flow works well overall but could benefit from enhancements that support scaling and clarity.

**Recommendations:**
- Define separate service accounts for automation vs. human accounts.
- Consider assigning dynamic groups for auto-enrollment based on user attributes.
- Introduce lifecycle status flags (`provisioned`, `active`, `inactive`, `offboarded`) for greater control and tracking.
- Align user cleanup actions (e.g., Azure disable, Tenable deletion, group removals) under a centralized status change trigger.

## 2. Entra ID Role Management

**Observation:** Role assignments were performed successfully using direct role definitions and object IDs, but may benefit from more granularity and guardrails.

**Recommendations:**
- Use Entra ID PIM (Privileged Identity Management) where applicable to enforce time-bound access.
- Document and map out roles tied to student access, admin access, and automation agents.
- Avoid using broad roles (e.g., `Owner`, `Contributor`) when finer-grained permissions are available.

## 3. Tenable IAM Integration

**Observation:** Tenable account provisioning and cleanup worked well through the API but had minimal error feedback or conflict resolution built in.

**Recommendations:**
- Introduce better exception handling for user creation and deletion.
- Log user lifecycle actions in both Azure and Tenable for traceability.
- Periodically validate Tenable users against an authoritative source (e.g., Google Sheet or Entra ID group) to catch drift.

## 4. Automation Resilience

**Observation:** The automation is tightly integrated and effective but could benefit from additional fail-safes and auditing.

**Recommendations:**
- Consider retry logic or exponential backoff for key API calls (especially Azure, which may return 429s under load).
- Add a logging mechanism for all automated actions (write to a storage account or secure log service).
- Store all credentials in a centralized key vault with strict access policies and rotation.

---

## 5. IAM Logging and Visibility

**Observation:** Azure Monitor and Microsoft Sentinel were used for alerting and visibility, but there is room to expand.

**Recommendations:**
- Enable diagnostic logs on key Entra ID events (e.g., user creation, role assignment, password resets).
- Set up Sentinel detection rules for suspicious IAM events like repeated account lockouts or privilege escalation.
- Use Workbooks in Azure Monitor to visualize identity-related KPIs.
